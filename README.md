Looking at how to algo-trade in the stock market.  Of more interest is stock is a good numerical data to experiment with different regression models and how they function in sciKit-learn Python module.
HTML, iPython and python files are all the same code.  The HTML is the easist to glance through.

## 1) First Look
Note 1.4) under First look. The error of deviation shows how random a gamble utilizing only High/Low data is.  Great start to understanding how these models work but not enough for investing.

This is using yfinance after 4 other pulls discontinued over the years.  Pulls all Stock high/low
## 3) Model testing (SciKit)
Uses sqlite to store the data in along with Pandas for comparing different results with different models
